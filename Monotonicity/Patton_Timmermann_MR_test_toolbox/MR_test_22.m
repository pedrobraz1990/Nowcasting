%  THIS FUNCTION IS FOR VARIABLES SORTED ON A SINGLE FACTOR
%
%  INPUTS:  data, a Txn matrix of returns on the n portfolios
%           bootreps, a scalar, the number of bootstrap replications to use for the MR test (default=1000)
%           direction, =  1 if want to test for an *increasing* relationship, 
%                      = -1 if want to test for a *decreasing* relationship, 
%                      =  0 (default) if want to use the sign of (muhat_n-muhat_1) to determine the sign to look at
%                      =  2, if data are already in differences (eg: for two-way sorts) and want to test for an *increasing* relationship
%                      = -2, if data are already in differences (eg: for two-way sorts) and want to test for an *decreasing* relationship
%           block_length, a scalar, the average length of the block to use in Politis and Romano's stationary bootstrap (default=10)
%           rand_state, a scalar, the "seed" for Matlab's random number generator (default is sum(100*clock) )
%
%  OUTPUTS: out1, a 4x2 vector, (1) the t-statistic associated with a t-test that mu_1=mu_n, 
%                               (2) the p-value associated with a t-test that mu_1=mu_n, 
%                               (3) the MR test p-value from the proposed test (non-studentised)
%                               (4) the MR test p-value from the proposed test, on ALL pair-wise comparisons (non-studentised)
%                   first column is non-studentised, second column is studentised (NOTE: tstats and pvals are not affected by studentisation, so are the same)
