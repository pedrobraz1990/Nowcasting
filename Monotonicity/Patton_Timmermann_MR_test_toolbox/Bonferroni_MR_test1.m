% below are "Bonferroni p-values", in the sense that we reject the null if
% they are less than the size of the test. NOTE of course that unlike usual
% p-vals these won't be Unif(0,1) under the null. In fact, they do not even
% have to lie in [0,1] - they could be bigger than 1.
out1(1) = K*normcdf(min(tstats));  % if this is less than alpha (size of test) then reject H0 in favour of H1
out1(2) = K*normcdf(-max(tstats)); % if this is less than alpha (size of test) then reject H0* in favour of H1*
