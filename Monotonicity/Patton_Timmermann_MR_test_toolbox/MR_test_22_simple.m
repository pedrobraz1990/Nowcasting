%
%  THIS FUNCTION IS FOR VARIABLES SORTED ON A SINGLE FACTOR
%
%  INPUTS:  data, a Txn matrix of returns on the n portfolios
%           bootreps, a scalar, the number of bootstrap replications to use for the MR test (default=1000)
%           direction, =  1 if want to test for an *increasing* relationship, 
%                      = -1 if want to test for a *decreasing* relationship, 
%                      =  0 (default) if want to use the sign of (muhat_n-muhat_1) to determine the sign to look at
%                      =  2, if data are already in differences (eg: for two-way sorts) and want to test for an *increasing* relationship
%                      = -2, if data are already in differences (eg: for two-way sorts) and want to test for an *decreasing* relationship
%           block_length, a scalar, the average length of the block to use in Politis and Romano's stationary bootstrap (default=10)
%           rand_state, a scalar, the "seed" for Matlab's random number generator (default is sum(100*clock) )
%
%  OUTPUTS: out1, a scalar, the MR test p-value from the proposed test
